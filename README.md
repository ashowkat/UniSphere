A website created by Amy and Aleezah that helps students organize and navigate through their coursework.
This webiste contains 3 different pages-- To-Do, Calendar, and Notes. 
The To-Do page is used to add tasks that you need to complete to a list. It also has options to delete the tasks and an undo button in case you accidentally delete a task. 
The Calendar page is used to visually show your events. You can add events and color code them to make it easier to see. 
The Notes page allows you to add sticky notes and color code them.
